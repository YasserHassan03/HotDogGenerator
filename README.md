In this coursework, you will build a generative latent diffusion model from scratch. Initially, you'll learn to create robust embeddings using a VAE. However, due to resource limitations, creating high-quality embeddings this way will prove too costly. Instead, we will use a pre-existing image encoder-decoder model from the backbone of Stable Diffusion 2. Based on this, you will train a latent diffusion model (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models - DDPM with pretrained VAE latent embeddings). We will generate new images from pure noise, without prompt conditioning or other frills.

Our goal is inspired by the famous hot-dog detector from the TV show Silicon Valley ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0)), which turned out to be a more challenging machine learning problem than the show's creators might have anticipated. You will train a hot-dog generator using a clean and highly curated dataset. Afterwards, you'll test your model with a hot-dog detector we've provided to see if it can produce plausible hot-dog images.
